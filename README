DBIx::TmpDB
===========

Temporary database runner

This software is intended to use in unit tests mostly. It creates different
temporary databases and automatically destroys them afterwards.

MySQL, Postgres and SQLite are supported now. You are welcome to add more
backends.

INSTALLATION

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

USAGE

You can run the tmpdb command line utility, or you can use the DBIx::TmpDB
package in your Perl program.

See the POD documentation in the corresponding files.

BUGS

There are no known bugs in the program but may be unknown yet. Let me know
if you found some of them.

My English is poor so the documentation leaves much to be desired. If you
can help to improve it don't hesitate to contact me.
